## The Game

Create a game with any number of `rounds`. Once a game is created a challenger can join. Once this happens the game can begin.

1. Each player submits a poseidon hash of their move along with a secret via the `Commit` system
2. Once both moves have been submitted, each player can reveal their move via the `Reveal` system, which checks the hash
3. Once revealed anyone can call the `Resolve` which will complete the round
